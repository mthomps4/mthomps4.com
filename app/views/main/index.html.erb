    <p class="my-4 font-bold">Software Architect by Day | Unplugged Engineer by Night</p>
    <p class="my-4">I'm a builder and creator at heart.</p>
    <p class="my-4">For over a decade, I've been immersed in the software consulting world, working across industries such as IP Advertising, Healthcare, Telecom, and E-Commerce. I've helped companies understand and solve complex problems while leading teams to drive progress. My primary focus is on solving the right problems and fostering team growth. No one should tackle this kind of work alone. I aim to share my understanding and pitfalls in hopes of building momentum.</p>
    <p class="my-4">During the day, I find myself meeting with stakeholders, project leads, and engineering teams, aiming to define and resolve the problems at hand. My goal is to offer multiple solutions, focusing on what makes sense for both today and the future. I scout ahead, carving a path of options for others to follow.</p>
    <p class="my-4">Beyond software, my passion extends into the physical world of fine woodworking, metalworking, and tool restoration. This pursuit is more than a hobbyâ€”it's a commitment to preserving and advancing craftsmanship. By collecting books, articles, and resources, I strive to safeguard the knowledge and history of these trades. I aspire to absorb all I can and share this rich legacy with the next generation. And who knows? Maybe one day, I'll bridge the gap between traditional craftsmanship and modern technology in a unique pet project. (AI and Robotics, anyone?)</p>
    <p class="my-4">Come along with me on this journey of learning, building, and creating in all sorts of ways.</p>
