    <h2>About the Armory</h2>
    <p>If I have a "Digital Forge", then I guess I'll name this page the "the Tool Armory". I guess?! Naming is hard.</p>
    <p>While software has become may day job. I've always had a desire to build, regardless of the medium. As a kid, my love for woodworking started by watching those around me (and on PBS - <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/woodwrights-shop/" target="_blank">Thanks you Roy Underhill</a>). Folks in my area knew how to be resourceful, everything had a purpose or could be repurposing. No waste. I watched as logs, that were otherwise destined to rot, would be taken and slowly shape it into cabinets and fine furniture. I was fascinated to say the least, and observed as knowledge was passed around from one to another.</p>
    <p>Since the interwebs, we've lost a lot of knowledge from these trades and traditions. I'm not saying it's all gone, but it's not as easy to find. A lot of craft and detail was passed verbially on the job from others who started learning the trade early on in the same manner. I've been fortunate to have a few mentors along the way, but I've also had to do a lot of digging on my own and while the internet is great, there are some things you can't learn from YouTube. I eventually stumbled upon a few books and articles from Christopher Schwarz at <a href="https://lostartpress.com/collections/books-by-christopher-schwarz" target="_blank">the Lost Art Press</a> and other Instagram builders (named below). Chris seemed to have made it his life goal to document, publish, and share all he could find about these dieing traditions (at least within the Woodworking world). I was a bit hooked to say the least. I've been collecting and restoring hand tools ever since. I've been fortunate to find some great deals on eBay and at local antique shops, and have been blessed with some amazing gifts from friends and family. I am by no means a profiessional, my goals are a bit more tame, I simply want to collect, and share the knowledge and resources found with others in hopes of keeping these traditions alive. Maybe the collection of books and notes will one day be of use to another. At least in my mind, there's one book in circulation.</p>
    <p>While my attention staring out has mainly been related to Woodworking, my interests lie in all Trades. If you are a maker, my hope is that you find this space helpful and if you have resources to mention or follow please reach out! I'm happy to link and support.</p>
